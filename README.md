# Arduino Snap

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/arduino)

This is the repository of [the Arduino IDE snap](https://snapcraft.io/arduino).

## Custom themes

This snap includes the [Dark Arduino Theme](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkArduinoTheme) as an option. You can enable it in File > Preferences > Theme.

If you want to add a different theme, you can do so by placing the `.zip` file of the theme in the folder `~/snap/arduino/current/Arduino/theme`. You might need to create this folder first. *The `.zip` file needs to include all the files in the `theme` folder of your theme. Make sure to zip the contents, not the directory itself, so the theme files are in the root of the zip instead of in the theme folder.*
